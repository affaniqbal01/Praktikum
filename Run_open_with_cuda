Internship Report: Configuration and Utilization of CUDA with OpenCV
## Abstract
This report details the configuration and use of CUDA within an OpenCV environment during an internship. The focus was on setting up a development environment optimized for CUDA acceleration and verifying the successful integration of various components. The configuration steps, system specifications, and build processes are outlined to demonstrate the approach and results of this technical setup.

1. Introduction
The integration of CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) with OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) was undertaken to enhance computational performance for image and video processing tasks. CUDA provides parallel computing capabilities, which are leveraged to accelerate processing tasks in OpenCV. The purpose of this report is to document the process of configuring OpenCV with CUDA support and to provide insights into the system specifications and build settings used.
