# Bugs:
1. pressing the button very quick. It doesnt respond / no action / no starting or stop of recording. Solution: press and hold the button for 1 a moment (1~2 Seconds).
2. Pressing the twice. It creasts the crash file (i guess the video is not completely saved. Solution: Dont press it twice (wait for the button to blink or to be stable)
3. Plugging the Usb out while running. It crashes the Usb sometimes and then usb needs to be resset. Solution turn it of and then remove the usb safely.
4.
